						<h3> Introduction </h3>
                         <p>Laser cutting is one of the topics that I am the most excited about in Dfab because I always thought that it is very cool that I can engrave my art on wood. </P>
						 
                       
                       <h3>Vector and Raster images</h3>
                       <img src="images/raster%20vector.JPG" width="500px" height= "300px" />
                       <p> In short , Vector images are made up of clear lines formed through mathematical equations and Raster images are made up of pixels. </p>
                       
                       <img src="images/time.JPG" width="500px" height= "300px" />
                       <p> A machine will have a easier time going through mathematical equations than a handful of pixels , as a result , Vector images takes a lot shorter to finish than Raster images </p>

                       <h3>Engraving and cutting</h3>
                       <p> A laser cutter is powerful enough to slice through materials or engrave/etch them.  </p>
                       <p>However,in order to tell the laser cutter whether to engrave or slice , there are several things that must be done and to be considered.</p>
                       
                       <ol>
                           <li><h3>what Material you are going to use</h3></li>
                           <img src="images/material.JPG" width="500px" height= "300px" />
                           
                           <li><h3>What file type to use</h3></li>
                           <img src="images/file type.JPG" width="500px" height= "300px" />
                           <li><h3>Which lines to turn off hairline and which lines not to </h3></li>
                           <p>In coreldraw , </p>
                           <ul>
                               <li>For vector cut , set line weight to hairline </li>
                               <li>For vector engraving , set line weight to anything thicker than 0.0001</li>
                               <li>For raster engraving, set line weight to anything thicker than 0.0001</li>
                            <p> if it is vector cutting, set lines to RGB red, R255,G0,B0 </p>
                            <p>if it is vector engraving, set lines to RGB green,R0,G255,B0 </p>
                           </ul>
                           
                       
                       
                       <li><h3> Speed , Power , Frequency </h3></li>
                       <p> Speed , power and frequency are 3 important setting that must be considered when laser cutting.</p>
                           <br>
                           <p>The slower the speed the laser nozzle move , the deeper it will cut into the material aan vice versa</p>
                           <p>Power is how powerful the laser cuts at any  given moment.So obviously the more power , the deeper it cuts</p>
                           <p>Frequency or PPI , pusle per minute , is how fast the laser turns on and off while cutting.A high frequency will make a cleaner cut but if material is flammable , it may catch fire.A low frequency will make a less clean cut but lowers the risk of creating a fire.</p>
                           <br>
                           <p>These 3 settings must be balanced to make the cut you want.</p>
                           <p>For example, adjusting the power too high might burn away more material than intented , resulting in  inaccurate dimensions </p>
                           <p> So you might want to lower the speed and power to try again.</p>
                           <p>If it still burns away too much material, more trial and error must be done until you get the results you want.</p>
                       
                       </ol>
