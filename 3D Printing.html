				        <h2>3D Printing</h2>
						
						<h3> Introduction </h3>
                         <p>The Slicing software we will be using for this topic is called Cura </P>
						 
						 <p>After creating 3D models in Fusion 360, the models can be imported as a STL file into Cura, which can then bring the models to life. </p>
                       <br>
                       <p>However, even 3D printers have their limits and these limitations can be grouped into 4 categories. </p>
                       <br>
                       
                       
                       <h2>OverHangs</h2>
                       <p>Any part of a print that extends outwards without any support structures is known as a overhang.</p>
                       <p>Without anything to support the print, the part that is overhang will result in the material dripping downwards.</p>
                       <img src="images/Overhang.png" width="600px" height= "300px" />
                       
                       
                       
                       <h4>Solution </h4>
					<p>Simply adding a support structure that can be ripped out of the model afterwards will fix this problem. </p>
                       <br>
                       
                       <h2> Bridging </h2>
                       <p> Bridging is very similar to an overhang.The only difference is that bridging involves linking two raised points horizontally</p>
                        <img src="images/Bridge.jpg" width="500px" height= "300px" />
                        <h4>Solution </h4>
                       <p>Same as overhang</p>
                       <br>
                       <h2> Raft , Brim and Skirts</h2>
                       <p> Raft ,Brim and Skirts are something like base supports that ensure that printing goes smoothly so that the print material will not go to waste.</p>
                       
                       <h3> Raft </h3>
                       <p>Raft is used to support 3D prints ,with small bases, by creating a strong foundation. Raft also improves bed adhesion and prevent warping.However a raft uses a lot of material.</p>
                       <br>
                       <h3> Brim </h3>
				  <p>Brim is very similar to Raft except that Brim isnt as strong of a support and is used to hold down the edges of a print. </p>
                       <p>Like Raft , it also improves bed adhesion and prevent warping.</p>
                       <h3>Skirt</h3>
                       <p>Skirt does not serve as a base support unlike Raft and Brim , instead it is used for priming the extruder and early detection of any printing errors. </p>
                       
                    <h3>Infills</h3>
                       <p> Infills are what make up the inner structure of a print.</p>
                       <img src="images/infill.JPG" width="500px" height= "300px" />
				   <h4>Infill density </h4>
                       <p>A high infill density makes the print heavier and stronger.However it takes a lot longer , the denser the infill is. A low infill denisty makes the print more fragile and light but it uses way lesser materials and saves time.In Fablab, it is recommended that</p>
                       <img src="images/infill density.JPG" width="500px" height= "300px" />
                       
                       <ul>
                       <li>10%-15% infill for prototyping</li>
                           <li>20%-25% for finalising prototypes</li>
                           <li>30%-35% for large objects and should be avoided if possible</li>
                           <li>50%-100% should never be used because it is really slow and wastes material</li>
                       </ul>
                       
                       <img src="images/printers.JPG" width="500px" height= "400px" />
