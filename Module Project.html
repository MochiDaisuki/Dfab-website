						<h3> Introduction </h3>
                         <p>Here is my documentation for my final project </P>
						 
                       
                       <h2>Planning and sketching </h2>
                       
                       <h3>Project Draft Version 1.0 </h3>
                       <p> This is the very first draft for my final project , however after consultation with my lecturer I decided to spice it up a little </p>

                       <img src="images/DFab%20rework%202.png" width="500px" height= "500px" />
                       <h3>Materials need</h3>

                       <h3> Project update 8/2/2020</h3>
                       
                       <p> The first component I model is the 3D printed base for the mood lamp</p>
                       <p> I first plan out the measurements , taking into consideration the dimension of the breadboard and thickness of the wood used for the laser cut box.</p>
                       <img src="images/3d%20box%20plan.png" width="500px" height= "500px" />
                       <p> I plan out the various measurements inside Clip Studio Paint so that it would be very easy to model it out inside Fusion 360.</p>
                       <img src="images/3d box.JPG" width="600px" height= "350px" />
                       
                       
                       <h3>Project update 8/5/2020 </h3>
                       <p> For Embedded programing , I have a push button as the input and a RGB LED as the output.</p>
                       <p> Here is the schematic I have for this project</p>
                       <img src="images/schmatic.JPG" width="600px" height= "350px" />
                       
                       <p>and here is the code I will be using </p>
                       
                       <img src="images/code%201.JPG" width="350px" height= "600px" />
                       <img src="images/code%202.JPG" width="350px" height= "600px" />
                       
                       <p> I got my inspiration from two projects that is published on Arduino project hub</p>
                       <li><a href="https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/SHAHIR_nasar/simple-rgb-led-light-with-fade-635bc2"> RGB LED fading</a></li>
                       <li><a href="https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/gol73/innovation-lab-5-push-button-rgb-led-color-change-6f4453"> Button control</a></li>
                       
                       <p>I borrow the code from these two projects and tried to combine them</p>
                       <p> However I realise that there are mutiple problems with their code and could be optimised a lot more</p>
                       
                       <h4>Problems I found in both projects </h4>
                       <ol>
                       <li>The value of the resistor used are too high, 220 ohm should be used instead of 1k</li>
                        <li>The code did not put in the right variables </li>
                        <li>Some wires in the schematic are placed in the wrong position </li>
                        <li> Input should be Input-pullup instead of just Input</li>
                       </ol>
                       <p> I manage to fix all these problems eventually and that is how I came up with the code above.</p>
                       
                       <h3>Code breakdown</h3>
                       To put it in very simple terms , here is what the code do
                       <ol>
                           <li>The code checks which pins are the outputs and which are the inputs</li>
                           <li>It constantly checks if the button is pressed</li>
                           <li>If the button is pressed, it adds 1 to a counter which changes what the RGB LED do</li>
                           <li>The counter will first be equal to zero , which will tell the LED to fade in and out looping different colours at a time. </li>
                           <li>When the button is pushed , the counter will now be equal to 1</li>
                           <li> The RGB LED will have a red , green , blue light when the counter is equal to 1 , 2 and 3 respectively </li>
                           <li>If the counter is equal to 3 and the button is pressed , it will reset itself back to equal 0. </li>
                       </ol>
                       
                       <h3>Switch debounce problem</h3>
                        <p>I put everything I have inside Tinkercad and it works as intended.</p>
                       <p> However when I connected everything in real life , the button counter counts more times than it should.</p>
                       <p>That is when I realise there is a switch debouncing problem.</p>
                       
                       <video controls="controls" width="600" height="350" 
       name="Switch debounce" src="images/unfix%20led.MOV"></video>
                       
                       <h3>Project update 7/9/2020</h3>
                       <p>I did my laser cut box inside Fusion 360 in the same file as my 3d printed box</p>
                       <img src="images/lasercut%20model.JPG" width="600px" height= "350px" />
                       <p>I also made my 3d printed box 20mm shorter due to the fact that cura told me it would take 6 hours to print.</p>
                       <br> 
                       <h3>Using illustrator</h3>
                       <p> Now that I am finished modelling in Fusion 360 , I imported the sketch from Fusion 360 in DXF format and put it inside illustrator to combine it with a visual design.</p>
                       <img src="images/AI%20axf.JPG" width="600px" height= "350px" />
                       
                       <p> For prototyping I used images from the game called "Hollow Knight" as a placeholder to test if a similarly thin pattern I had in mind for the final design will work.</p>
                       <img src="images/hollow%20knight%201.png" width="300px" height= "300px" />
                       <img src="images/Hollow%20knight%202.png" width="300px" height= "300px" />
                       <p>Artist that created these designs</p>
                    <div class="tumblr-post" data-href="https://embed.tumblr.com/embed/post/KKrDWEJRZ7WVmwlkFmyThA/172421377337" data-did="10cbaa6c11aed82f817c83b6b7050aa0ff5a607e"><a href="https://polyvolchant.tumblr.com/post/172421377337/hello-artists-of-hollow-knight-here-have-these">https://polyvolchant.tumblr.com/post/172421377337/hello-artists-of-hollow-knight-here-have-these</a></div>  <script async src="https://assets.tumblr.com/post.js"></script>
                       
                       <p> However , the pattern are far too thin and the 3mm plywood I used turned into timber.</p>
                       <p>So I did a vector engraving instead to test if it would fit the 3D printed box.</p>
                       <img src="images/demo.jpg" width="600px" height= "500px" />
                       <p> Everything went fits just fine , however now I need to come up with another design that does not have very thin patterns. </p>
                       <h3>Second laser cut design</h3>
                       <p> I created a design base on a character known as " The hunter " from Hollow knights.</p>
                       <img src="images/hunter.JPG" width="500px" height= "300px" />
                       
                       <p>Here is what he looks like in game </p>
                       <img src="images/game%20screenshot.jpg" width="500px" height= "300px" />
                       <p> Here is what the pieces look like in illustrator</p>
                       <img src="images/design%202.JPG" width="500px" height= "300px" />
                       
                       <h3>8/12/2020</h3>
                       <p>I went back to school with fingers crossed that the patterns will turn out fine, because I was unable to make any changes if it does not. For context, my Laptop broke down and is under repair at a service center at the time.</p>
                       <br>
                       <p> Here is how it went</p>
                       <video controls="controls" width="600" height="350" 
       name="Switch debounce" src="images/laser%20cut.MOV"></video>
                       <img src="images/hunter%20piece.jpg" width="500px" height= "300px" />
                       
                       <p> Everything went well and now I got my pieces , so I assembled everything and here is what it look like.</p>
                       <img src="images/light.jpg" width="500px" height= "400px" />
                       <p>I notice that the LED i really bright and perhaps I should paste a paper behind the wood pieces so that light is more equally distributed.</p>
                       <h3>8/14/2020</h3>
                       <p> I went baack to school to soder my switch to 2 jumper wires since it keeps dropping off.</p>
                       <img src="images/soder.jpg" width="500px" height= "400px" />
